By default the openstack-dashboard cookbook ships with a self-signed certificate from a fake organization.
It is possible to use a real production certificate from your organization by putting that certificate
somewhere where the cookbook can download it from then simply passing in the URL of the certificate, and its
corresponding key, using the 'cert_url' and 'key_url' attributes.

Testing
=====

Please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for instructions for testing the cookbook.

Berkshelf
=====

Berks will resolve version requirements and dependencies on first run and
store these in Berksfile.lock. If new cookbooks become available you can run
`berks update` to update the references in Berksfile.lock. Berksfile.lock will
be included in stable branches to provide a known good set of dependencies.
Berksfile.lock will not be included in development branches to encourage
development against the latest cookbooks.
