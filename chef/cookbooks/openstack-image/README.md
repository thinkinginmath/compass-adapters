Description
===========

This cookbook installs the OpenStack Image service **Glance** as part of an OpenStack reference deployment Chef for OpenStack. The http://github.com/mattray/chef-openstack-repo contains documentation for using this cookbook in the context of a full OpenStack deployment. Glance is installed from packages, optionally populating the repository with default images.

http://glance.openstack.org/

Requirements
============

Chef 0.10.0 or higher required (for Chef environment use).

Cookbooks
---------

The following cookbooks are dependencies:

* openstack-common
* openstack-identity

Usage
=====

api
------
- Installs the glance-api server

client
----
- Install the glance client packages

registry
--------
- Installs the glance-registry server

keystone-registration
---------------------
- Registers the API endpoint and glance service Keystone user

image-upload
------------
- Upload image to glance. If you want to upload image during openstack installation, you need to add this recipe or the os-image role to the run list in a certain role and ensure before this recipe or the os-image role glance api and glance registry recipes have been executed.

The Glance cookbook currently supports file, swift, and Rackspace Cloud Files (swift API compliant) backing stores.  NOTE: changing the storage location from cloudfiles to swift (and vice versa) requires that you manually export and import your stored images.

To enable these features set the following in the default attributes section in your environment:

Files
-----

```json
"openstack": {
    "image": {
        "api": {
            "default_store": "file"
        },
        "upload_images": [
            "cirros"
        ]
    }
}
```

Swift
-----

```json
"openstack": {
    "image": {
        "api": {
            "default_store": "swift"
        },
        "upload_images": [
            "cirros"
        ]
    }
}
```

The following attributes are defined in attributes/default.rb of the common cookbook, but are documented here due to their relevance:

* `openstack['endpoints']['image-api-bind']['host']` - The IP address to bind the api service to
* `openstack['endpoints']['image-api-bind']['port']` - The port to bind the api service to
* `openstack['endpoints']['image-api-bind']['bind_interface']` - The interface name to bind the api service to

* `openstack['endpoints']['image-registry-bind']['port']` - The port to bind the registry service to
* `openstack['endpoints']['image-registry-bind']['bind_interface']` - The interface name to bind the registry service to

If the value of the 'bind_interface' attribute is non-nil, then the image service will be bound to the first IP address on that interface.  If the value of the 'bind_interface' attribute is nil, then the image service will be bound to the IP address specified in the host attribute.

Testing
=====

Please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for instructions for testing the cookbook.

Berkshelf
=====

Berks will resolve version requirements and dependencies on first run and
store these in Berksfile.lock. If new cookbooks become available you can run
`berks update` to update the references in Berksfile.lock. Berksfile.lock will
be included in stable branches to provide a known good set of dependencies.
Berksfile.lock will not be included in development branches to encourage
development against the latest cookbooks.
